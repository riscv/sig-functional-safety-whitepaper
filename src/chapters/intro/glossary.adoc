| *Term* | *Definition*

| ASIL
| Automotive Safety Integrity Level.
  Risk classification scheme defined by the ISO 26262 cite:[iso26262:2018]
  identifying four ASILs ranging from the lowest to the highest integrity
  requirements: ASIL A, ASIL B, ASIL C and ASIL D.

| CAST
| Certification Authorities Software Team.
  CAST is an international group of aviation certification and regulatory
  authority representatives.
  Inactive since 2016.

| CMO
| Cache Memory Operations (task group).

| DAL
| Design Assurance Level, term used in avionics systems to define the safety
level.
Safety levels are identified with letter, from A to E, with DAL A identifying
the highest safety requirements and DAL E for no safety requirement.

| Determinism
| Capability of a system that given the same input to the same initial state it
always generates the same outputs while passing through the same intermediate
states, no matter how many times the same input is presented to the system.

| DMA
| Direct-Memory Access.

| EASA
| European Union Aviation Safety Agency.

| ECC
| Error Correction Code.

| ECSS
| European Cooperation for Space Standardization.

| ESA
| European Space Agency.

| FAA
| Federal Aviation Administration.

| Fault, error and failure
| In the context of this document these terms refer to the series of events that
can put a system into a malfunctioning state: a _fault_ is an abnormal
condition that can cause an element to fail, which can cause an _error_ (a
discrepancy between a computed, observed or measured value/condition and the
true theoretical value/condition) which can ultimately provoke a permanent or
transient _failure_ on the system, that is the termination of the system
intended behavior.

| Interference
| Interference refers to the impact an event or task can have in the
execution of another task in a processor.
The interference can be observed as a variation on the task execution
and it is typically due to the use of processor shared resources.

| Hypervisor
| Thin software layer that provides abstraction of hardware to one or several
operating systems, by allowing them to run on the same host hardware.

| ID
| Identifier.

| IO
| Input/Output.

| IOATC
| IOMMU Address Translation Cache.

| IOMMU
| Input/Output Memory Management Unit.

| IPC
| Instructions Per Cycle.

| ISO
| International Organization for Standardization.

| LRU
| _Least-recently used_ algorithm.

| MCU
| Micro-Controller Unit.

| MMU
| Memory Management Unit.

| MSI
| Message Signaled Interrupt.

| OS
| Operating System.

| PLRU
| _Pseudo least-recently used_ algorithm.

| PMC
| Performance Monitoring Counter, also referred as Performance Counter.

| QoS
| Quality of Service.

| RTOS
| Real-Time Operating System.

| SECDED
| Single Error Correction Double Error Detection.

| SLA
| Service Level Agreement.

| SMP
| Symmetric Multi-Processing.

| TCM
| Tightly Coupled Memory. Also known as Closely-Coupled Memories (CCMs),
  scratchpad memories, local memories, Tightly Integrated Memories, or local
  memories.

| WCET
| Worst-Case Exection Time.
  In a computer system the WCET is the maximum time a task could take to
  execute.
