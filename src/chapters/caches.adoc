## Caches and Tightly Coupled Memories (TMCs)

[#sec:caches:safety]
### Safety needs

Caches and Tightly Coupled Memories (TCMs, also known as Closely-Coupled
Memories (CCMs), scratchpad memories, local memories, Tightly Integrated
Memories, or local store) are important components, particularly in high
performance CPUs, for mitigating the effects of difference in speed between the
processor and main memory.
These kinds of memories provide relatively small, fast on-chip storage close to
the processor to reduce the frequency of accesses to main memory, in order to
improve performance and reduce power consumption.

Caches offer a very convenient method to access data.
They are accessed implicitly -- software does not address them directly.
Hardware mechanisms take care of keeping copies of appropriate data in these
memories, and tracking which data is stored where.
However, they introduce a number of potential functional and safety related
issues:

* The implicit nature of the memory access through a cache memory, while very
convenient from a programming point of view (for non-safety-critical systems),
means there is little control over the transaction.
Dedicated instructions such as the CMO extensions or memory fences that may be
needed to ensure consistency (especially in a copy-back cache) are usually not
exposed in higher-level programming languages.
* While the average memory access time is reduced, variability of access time is
increased.
Multiple accesses to the same memory location may have widely differing access
times, depending upon cache state that is not easily predictable or
controllable by software.
* Concurrent access to different memory areas by different cores may be cached
in the same area (depending on cache associativity).
While the cache control hardware ensures the correct data is always returned,
this can result in one process affecting the timing and performance of another
process (e.g. through mutual eviction of data).
* The cache replacement (or eviction) policy may have an impact on the ability
to perform timing analysis.
For example a PLRU (pseudo least-recently used) algorithm can be more
difficult to analyze than true LRU (least-recently used).
* Coherency issues can occur as multiple (sometimes different) copies of the
same data are stored in different locations.
These issues can become very complex where multiple agents access the same
memory, and where multiple caches exist in a system.
While these issues are predictable and can be avoided with correct software
design, the requirements to achieve this may be non-trivial, and any bugs
introduced can be difficult to test for or identify.
Furthermore, coherency management may further increase the non-uniformity of
memory access times, for example directory-based cache coherency incurs
additional traffic on the interconnect, increasing risks of timing
interference.
* The type of fast memories that are required to implement caches, have an
increased susceptibility to soft errors, due to the very low charge involved
in storing a bit value.

Functionally safe systems must be able to provide temporal isolation (a lack of
interference of a software task by the previous state of the cache).

TCMs are accessed explicitly by software, and therefore provide more control to
the software over their use than caches do.
If used appropriately, a TCM can avoid or reduce the non-determinism that caches
can introduce.
There is however an additional burden on the software to manage this usage (for
example copying data into and out of the TCM).

[#sec:caches:safety:features]
#### Features

##### Cache partitioning

A cache memory may be shared between several processors (or other agents).
Even if a cache is private to a single core, it will normally be shared by all
harts and separate software threads time-multiplexed onto that hart.
This means any attempt to analyze the cache behavior for a single software
thread is complicated by a dependence on unrelated activity in the system (for
example: other software running, DMA transfers or system IO occurring).

Cache partitioning allows some portion of a cache (for example, specific ways)
to be allocated to a specific core, hart, or software thread.
This can significantly reduce performance dependencies between software threads,
and simplifies cache-related performance analysis.
It is likely, however, to reduce the overall efficiency of the cache allocation
mechanisms and therefore overall performance.

##### Cache lockdown

A cache implementation may include a facility to load data (or instructions)
into specific ways of the cache, then '_lock_' those ways, preventing them from
being selected for cache allocations and evictions.
This mechanism allows software to guarantee that accesses to particular
data/instructions will hit in the cache, improving determinism.
This can also improve the performance of a particular function.
Cache locking does, however, reduce the amount of cache available for other
data, thus reducing overall system performance.

Data locked into a cache in this manner incurs the area and power overheads
associated with tag RAMs and cache lookups, so it is a relatively inefficient
method of storing critical data.
However, it does provide flexibility to divide cache resources dynamically
between standard cached and selected critical data.
In practice this allocation is likely to be a static configuration during
run-time.

Cache lockdown should not generally be used for data that is not exclusively
accessed through the same cache, for example memory that may also be directly
updated by a DMA controller.
If it is, any software coherency management schemes may need to unlock, reload
and relock such data.
Hardware cache coherency mechanisms may not be constrained by cache locking and
still perform evictions, possibly requiring manual reloading and relocking.

##### Tightly Coupled Memory

Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM) provides deterministic (usually fast) access to a
defined area of the address space.
The physical memory address space it is mapped to will usually be configurable
at run time.
TCM is typically implemented as SRAM, but there can also be other types of
memory, such as flash or ROM.
If the TCM is implemented as volatile memory, an external access mechanism may
allow the TCM to be initialized before the processor comes out of reset,
allowing boot from the TCM.
Alternatively, the CPU may boot from external memory, and load the TCM (using a
bootloader or dynamically when creating a task) before executing code from it.
While many topologies are possible and widely used, TCM is often implemented
with separate instruction and data memories, offering improved performance and
determinism.

TCM is often private to a single core, which is a useful property to allow
processing in isolation.
A TCM that is shared may enable this by allowing the core to disable external
access (after initialization, for example).

Some systems allow the configuration of the same fast memory area either fully
or partially to either cache or scratchpad mode of operation.
For example, three-quarters may be used as cache and the remaining quarter as
TCM.

##### Fast System Memory

High performance compute systems usually have a complex memory system which can
concurrently process multiple outstanding accesses from multiple processor cores
and other agents, and complete them out-of-order (within defined constraints).
This can deliver high performance while making efficient use of shared resources
such as communication paths through an interconnect.
However, this introduces another potential source of interference between
processes.
If one process floods the memory system with many requests, another may be
forced to wait for the completion of an access which could otherwise have
completed quickly.

Processors may implement additional memory interfaces to provide a dedicated
path to memory or peripherals for specific address spaces, avoiding influence
from the main memory subsystem.
Alternatively, priority and QoS signaling on the main system bus can work in
conjunction with the system interconnect to similarly ensure deterministic
accesses.

##### Fault tolerance

Cache and TCM memories are inherently vulnerable to random errors and some form
of redundancy will typically be required to mitigate the risk introduced by
these (see <<sec:redundancy>>).
This is usually implemented in the form of parity bits or ECC.
Instruction caches and write-through data caches store copies of data that are
also valid in external memory (possibly subject to various buffers being
drained).
In these cases, error detection without hardware correction is often sufficient
(though multi-bit error detection may still be required) as the correct data can
be reloaded from main memory.
TCM and copy-back data/combined caches may contain the only valid copy of active
data, so error correction is often required (SECDED protection is common for
ISO 26262).

##### Address translation

For systems implementing virtual to physical address translation, a translation
lookaside buffer (TLB) is frequently used to cache address translations stored
in tables in external memory.
TCMs and caches are usually physically addressed (or at least physically
tagged), so a TLB miss can introduce non-deterministic response times, in a
similar way to a cache miss.
In systems where a TLB miss is managed in hardware (also known as hardware page
table walks), additional implicit traffic on the interconnect is generated, and
it may also evict data from other tasks in data caches.

TLB lockdown (similar to cache lockdown) or a software-controlled section of the
TLB are possible solutions to this.

[#sec:caches:safety:level]
#### Level

Level 1 caches (which may be the only caches in simpler systems) are generally
associated with a single core.
Larger systems may contain several levels of cache, where the higher levels may
be shared among several processors, a larger subsystem, or the entire SoC.
Cache partitioning is more common in caches shared between multiple processors
but could also be implemented in a single-core cache with a partition devoted to
either a single hart or a subset of software threads scheduled to run on that
single hart.
Cache lockdown could be used in any level of cache.

TCMs may have different coupling tightness, from tight core integration, to L1
bus connection, to L2 or L3 interconnect, and therefore may be associated with a
single core (and shared among harts within that core), shared between several
cores, or the entire SoC.

While caches, TCMs and their integration within an SoC are hardware concerns,
all of them have an important impact at the software level.
Software typically has to manage the capabilities offered by these components
and their integration in the SoC. Examples include but are not limited to:

* Managing the cache capabilities like locking and partitioning.
* Managing cache coherency, e.g. defining which data needs hardware coherency
management.
* Managing which data needs to be stored in a TCM and when.
* Performing appropriate cache maintenance operations, for example cleaning the
data cache and invalidating the instruction cache after code is written to
memory.

[#sec:caches:safety:importance]
#### Importance

Caches are not a requirement originating from safety considerations -- indeed
they introduce additional safety concerns.
However, caches often provide essential improvements in system performance and
reduction in power consumption, and shared caches (usually at the L2 level and
deeper) are required to support symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) efficiently.

Deterministic response times, even in the presence of caches, is often a
"Must Have" requirement, and many of the mechanisms here are approaches to
help achieve this.

TCMs are often a “Must Have” requirement, in order to provide the fast,
deterministic behavior required by many safety-critical applications, and to
help ensure freedom from interference between processes.

[#sec:caches:safety:justification]
#### Justification

Caches, TCMs, and the memory subsystem are some of the main shared components
in a system.
As such, they are important contention points to be considered in its design.

In avionics, the CAST 32-A cite:[cast32:2016] guideline mandates that the interference channels are
identified and mitigated.
Caches, as a shared resource between different tasks in a hart or between harts,
represent a significant interference channel.
TCMs, being typically attached to a single core, naturally mitigate most of the
interferences, however the software running in the core should ensure its
management to mitigate interferences between the different tasks that might use
them (and between the harts within the core, if more than one hart accesses the
TCM).

Likewise, in the automotive domain, the ISO 26262 cite:[iso26262:2018] part 6
(software) requires freedom from interference across different software
partitions.
Caches and TCMs are a potential source of dependent failures and/or interference
through resource sharing, which should be mitigated.

[#sec:caches:rv]
### RISC-V solutions

The RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification cite:[rv-priv-spec:2024] Section 3.6.6
describes Physical Memory Attributes (PMAs) including cacheability, and allows
for a platform-specific scheme to mark particular areas of physical memory as
non-cacheable.
This scheme may be either fixed or configurable by Machine Mode Software.
This satisfies safety requirements for disabling the effect of caches for
particular data areas (though not through a standardized mechanism).
For paged virtual-memory systems, if implemented the _Svpbmt_ (Page-Based Memory
Types) extension (see
RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification cite:[rv-priv-spec:2024] Chapter 12)
provides a more suitable and standardized method for achieving the same
objective.

The RISC-V Unprivileged ISA Specification cite:[rv-unpriv-spec:2024] Chapter 17
defines the RISC-V Weak Memory Ordering model, applied to main memory.
The weak ordering model can improve overall performance, but provides less
predictability than a strongly ordered model.

In the RISC-V Unprivileged ISA Specification cite:[rv-unpriv-spec:2024] Chapter
19, the Cache Management Operations TG specified instructions to manage a Cache
Block (with architecture-dependant block size):

* The _Zicbom_ extension defines a set of cache-block management instructions:
`CBO.INVAL`, `CBO.CLEAN`, and `CBO.FLUSH`
* The _Zicboz_ extension defines a cache-block zero instruction: `CBO.ZERO`
* The _Zicbop_ extension defines a set of cache-block prefetch instructions:
`PREFETCH.R`, `PREFETCH.W`, and `PREFETCH.I`

### Recommendations

[#sec:caches:recom:isa]
#### RISC-V ISA specification recommendations

. In order to provide temporal isolation (a lack of interference of a software
task by the previous state of the cache), operations to clean and invalidate
the entirety of the  cache should be supported.
If the cache is partitioned, these operations could act on a single partition.
Alternatively, set/way operations should be supported, which can be used to
synthesize such entire cache/partition operations.
+
The ability to control (clean/invalidate) caches is provided in the (ratified)
"Base Cache Maintenance Operations” extensions, more specifically the _Zicbom_
(Cache Block Management) extension.
These specify “block operations” -- operations related to a particular
physical address range.
This mechanism is suitable for implementing a software cache coherency scheme
in situations where software knows that an external agent (that is not
hardware-coherent with the cache) may have written to (for the invalidate
operation) or is about to read from (for the clean operation) a specific
buffer of data.
However, it is not well suited to resetting the cache to a known state to
provide the temporal isolation discussed here, as one can expect the size of
a _Zicbom_ block to be too small to effectively use the entire address space.
. Traditionally, safe processors required the ability to remove or disable
caches to ensure maximal predictability. Other solutions have emerged since,
to avoid the drastic induced performance loss.
However a standard mechanism for globally disabling and enabling the caches
could be considered in future RISC-V specifications to embrace all approaches.
Note that there are two standard ways to achieve this with current
specifications, but both have significant drawbacks (there may also be
implementation specific mechanisms):
.. If the _Svpbmt_ (Page-Based Memory Types) extension is implemented, memory
pages can be marked as non-cacheable in the page table, overriding the PMA
attributes.
While in some situations this may be feasible, it either requires maintaining
an alternate set of page tables, or updating existing page tables.
It should be possible to activate or deactivate temporarily and temporally
the cacheability of memory regions.
.. Marking all memory locations as non-cacheable using the PMA mechanism.
This functionality is platform defined (so may not be configurable for all or
any memory regions), and it is not consistent with the intended use-model for
PMA as described in the RISC-V Privileged ISA Specification
cite:[rv-priv-spec:2024] Section 3.6:
“PMAs are inherent properties of the underlying hardware and rarely change
during system operation.
Unlike Physical Memory Protection (PMP) values described in Section 3.7, PMAs
do not vary by execution context”.

Standardized control and discovery mechanisms for TCM (and other memory
architectures) can be considered.
These are not, however, considered important in a safety context.
Safety-critical code using TCM for determinism purposes will need to be targeted
and extensively analyzed for a particular hardware platform -- this design
methodology is not consistent with software auto-discovering hardware features
and adapting behavior accordingly.

[#sec:caches:recom:non-isa]
#### Non-ISA recommendations

. As they are susceptible to random errors, the memories used to implement
caches (including tag/valid RAMs) and TCMs should be analyzed thoroughly for
the effects of potential errors on the functional safety of the system.
It is highly likely that these memories will need to be protected by some form
of redundancy -- often an ECC scheme is the most efficient way to meet these
safety requirements.
. Many safety-critical systems require isolation from interference from other
software tasks (maybe with a lower safety integrity level).
TCM that is private to a particular core can be extremely useful in delivering
this isolation.
If a TCM is accessible from other cores or agents (for example, can be
accessed over the system bus by a DMA) it should be possible to disable this
external access when required for isolation.
. In order to allow thorough safety analysis, the cache replacement policy,
associativity, and effect of cache-related instructions should be precisely
documented, including scope of achievable isolation, e.g. in mixed-criticality
systems.
An analyzable cache replacement policy is desirable.
. A shared cache should have as many access ports (and associated request
queues) as independent paths in the corresponding interconnect, in order to
identify and minimize interference channels.
. If cache partitioning is supported, the number of ways in a shared cache is
typically a multiple of the number of harts that are sharing that level of
cache, so that a way can uniquely be assigned to a hart.
. Cache locking can be a way of implementing TCM-like functionality.
