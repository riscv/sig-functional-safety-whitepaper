Functional safety refers to the mechanisms and methods
ensuring the correct operation of safety critical systems, such as avoiding
human casualties or ecological catastrophes.
Functional safety solutions ensure that the system remains in a safe state on
the occurrence of spurious or systematic errors, hardware failures, and
stressing environmental and operational conditions.
Safety is a system requirement and what are the parts of the systems that
require to implement a functional safety solution heavily depends on the system,
its constraints and its requirements.
Thus while products for a safety critical domain such as avionics might
implement a series of functional safety solutions to ensure the safety of the
product, products on a different domain might not implement the same ones
because of different requirements and constraints, even if some fundamentals
might be shared.

Safety requirements on the different safety critical domains extend to their
computing elements, including the processors and operating systems, from their
conception to the their exploitation.
Safety critical domains such as automotive, avionics, space and transports
define standards with functional safety properties the computing elements
hardware and address should address.
Which properties a computing element should address will depend on how it is
being integrated in the final system (e.g. a car or  a plane) to support the
functional safety of the latter.
As defined by Avizenis et al. cite:[avizenis:2001] these properties, which
Avizenis et al. group under the concept of _dependability_, include:

* Availability: readiness for correct service.
* Reliability: continuity of correct service.
* Safety: absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s) and the
  environment.
* Integrity: absence of improper system state alterations.
* Maintainability: ability to undergo repairs and modifications.

Different technical and non-technical solutions are used or followed by
industry, and academia, to ensure these properties.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of those solutions:

* Verification of ISA compliance to ensure computation correctness.
* Use of saturated floating-point arithmetic to avoid overflows or underflows,
  a design choice to ensure data integrity.
* Use of memory management units (MMU) or physical memory protection (PMP) to
  ensure memory-space isolation.
* Use of designs providing spatial redundancy (e.g. lockstep) or temporal
  redundancy (e.g. replay) allowing continuous operation in the presence of
  a fault to improve the reliability.
  These redundancy solutions can be augmented with diversity/dissimilarity to
  minimize common failure modes.
* Parity or error detection/correction codes (EDC, ECC) for the reliability
  of memory elements (e.g. caches).
* Performance monitoring capabilities to detect/control time interferences
  and observability in general.
* Debug interfaces for the external observability of the SoCs.
* Extensive use of documentation, including complete design descriptions,
  -- sometimes only available under NDA -- providing detailed description
  of the SoC functional and time behavior required to ensure the explainability
  of the isolation between the different software running on top of it.

The purpose of this document is to describe different mechanisms and methods
used in the safety critical domain industry to assess these functional safety
properties for their computing elements, both software and hardware.
Such mechanisms and methods should be considered in the design of RISC-V based
computing elements, including but not limited at the ISA level, to foster the
adoption of RISC-V on safety critical domains.

### Disclaimer

This document does not try address all the functional safety mechanisms and
methods, neither to fully discuss the ones addressed.
Furthermore, the specifications issued by RISC-V International being
continuously amended, updated and extended the identified gaps, recommendations
and solutions discussed in this document might be incomplete or outdated.

Finally, the contents of this document are limited to the knowledge of its
contributors.
If you find missing, incomplete, or outdated information in this document please
contact the Functional Safety Special Interest Group (Functional Safety SIG) at

exactitude of this document.

### Scope

// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================
// Current chapters.
// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================
This whitepaper currently includes chapters for the following topics:

* Caches and tightly coupled memories (TCM), see <<sec:caches>>;
* Performance counters, see <<sec:pmc>>;
* Quality of Service (QoS), see <<sec:qos>>;
* Redundancy, see <<sec:redundancy>>;
* And Partitioning, see <<sec:partitioning>>.

Additional chapters will be added in the future to address other functional
safety topics.
Likewise, current chapters will be updated and/or extended as required, e.g.
adding new references to new RISC-V specifications that address any of the
topics of those chapters.

// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================
// Organization of the chapters.
// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================

All the chapters follow the same structure:

* The *Safety needs* section describes the chapter topic relation with safety
  requirements on safety critical systems.
* The *RISC-V solutions* section identifies current RISC-V specifications that
  address the chapter topic.
* The *Recommendations* section provides some recommendations on how the current
  RISC-V specifications can be exploited to address the chapter topic and
  identifies potential gaps in current specifications.
* The *Related activities* section provides links to external bodies addressing
  the chapter topic and other chapters related to the topic.
