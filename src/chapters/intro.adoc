Functional safety is one aspect of system design that ensures electronic and
electrical systems operate safety even when faults occur.
It is particularly critical in industries where failure can lead to serious
consequences to people, the environment and equipment.

This discipline is guided by international standards like IEC 61508
cite:[iec16508-1:2010] (the foundational standard for functional safety across
many industries), and industry-specific standards for domains such automotive,
avionic, space and rail transport systems.
These standards typically define process requirements for risk assessment,
safety management, system architecture, testing, and validation, and are aimed
at achieving a specified Safety Integrity Level (SIL) or ASIL (Automotive SIL)
in the case of ISO 26262 cite:[iso26262:2018].

At its core, functional safety is about identifying safety-related risks,
defining and implementing appropriate risk treatment e.g. by detecting,
preventing, and mitigating the risks caused by unexpected behavior.
Fundamentally, it involves designing systems that are robust to systematic and
random failures, i.e. that they are unlikely to fail in an unsafe manner, or
they can enter a safe state when a safety-related failure occurs.

Safety requirements play a key role across all safety-related industries, where
safety requirements, that are derived from system design and analysis, are
cascaded to the computing elements of the system, e.g. the processors and
operating systems.
The safety requirements of the computing elements are heavily influenced by the
properties required of the nominal use case e.g. a car or a plane.
As defined by Avizenis et al. cite:[avizenis:2001] these properties are grouped
under the concept of _dependability_, i.e.:

* Availability: readiness for correct service.
* Reliability: continuity of correct service.
* Safety: absence of catastrophic consequences on the user(s) and the
  environment.
* Integrity: absence of improper system state alterations.
* Maintainability: ability to undergo repairs and modifications.

Different technical and non-technical solutions are used or followed by
industry, and academia, to ensure these properties.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of those solutions:

* Verification of ISA compliance to ensure computation correctness.
* Use of saturated floating-point arithmetic to avoid overflows or underflows,
  a design choice to ensure data integrity.
* Use of memory management units (MMU) or physical memory protection (PMP) to
  ensure memory-space isolation.
* Use of designs providing spatial redundancy (e.g. lockstep) or temporal
  redundancy (e.g. replay) allowing continuous operation in the presence of
  a fault to improve the reliability.
  These redundancy solutions can be augmented with diversity/dissimilarity to
  minimize common failure modes.
* Parity or error detection/correction codes (EDC, ECC) for the reliability
  of memory elements (e.g. caches).
* Performance monitoring capabilities to detect/control time interferences
  and observability in general.
* Debug interfaces for the external observability of the SoCs.
* Extensive use of documentation, including complete design descriptions,
  -- sometimes only available under NDA -- providing detailed description
  of the SoC functional and time behavior required to ensure the explainability
  of the isolation between the different software running on top of it.

The purpose of this document is to describe different mechanisms and methods
used in the safety critical domain industry to assess these functional safety
properties for their computing elements, both software and hardware.
Such mechanisms and methods should be considered in the design of RISC-V based
computing elements, including but not limited at the ISA level, to foster the
adoption of RISC-V on safety critical domains.

### Disclaimer

This document does not try address all the functional safety mechanisms and
methods, neither to fully discuss the ones addressed.
Furthermore, the specifications issued by RISC-V International being
continuously amended, updated and extended the identified gaps, recommendations
and solutions discussed in this document might be incomplete or outdated.

Finally, the contents of this document are limited to the knowledge of its
contributors.
If you find missing, incomplete, or outdated information in this document please
contact the Functional Safety Special Interest Group (Functional Safety SIG) at

accuracy of this document.

### Scope

// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================
// Current chapters.
// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================
This white paper currently includes chapters for the following topics:

* Caches and tightly coupled memories (TCM), see <<sec:caches>>;
* Performance counters, see <<sec:pmc>>;
* Quality of Service (QoS), see <<sec:qos>>;
* Redundancy, see <<sec:redundancy>>;
* Partitioning, see <<sec:partitioning>>.

Additional chapters will be added in the future to address other functional
safety topics.
Likewise, current chapters will be updated and/or extended as required, e.g.
adding new references to new RISC-V specifications that address any of the
topics of those chapters.

// =============================================================================
// =============================================================================
// Organization of the chapters.

All the chapters follow the same structure:

* The *Safety needs* section describes the chapter topic relation with safety
  requirements on safety critical systems.
* The *RISC-V solutions* section identifies current RISC-V specifications that
  address the chapter topic.
